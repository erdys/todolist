# To-Do List

Create a to-do list application using React.js that allows users to add, reorder, and remove tasks using drag-and-drop
interactions. This task will test your ability to work with React state management and user interactions.

The demo is available [here](https://demo.berdychowski.com/todolist/).

## Technologies

-   **React-Beautiful-DND**: A library for creating drag-and-drop interfaces in React. The library was developed and is maintained by Atlassian, a company known for products such as Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket.

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

The `dev` command will start a dev server and watch for code changes in JS and CSS files. Hot reloading is enabled, so that any change will be visible in your browser as you type.

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production usage, run the `build` command and everything packed together into the `dist` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```
